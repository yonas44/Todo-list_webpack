## Getting Started

In this project I built a simple HTML list of To Do tasks using webpack and served by a webpack dev server along with ES6 modules.

- The webpage will allow users to add lists easily using the input field.
- The completed tasks will each have a line through, implying the task is complete.
- The completed tasks can be removed all together using a button.

### Setup

Run git clone https://github.com/yonas44/Todo-list_webpack.git
Run cd Todo-list_webpack.git
Run npm install
Run npm start
